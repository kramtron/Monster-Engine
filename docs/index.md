## Last assigment

In the last assignment i done an animation Update, where we can load animations and play it in our engine. 
* Techincal information:
 First I made different functions to load the bones of the mesh. Then I made another function where I look if the imported fbx has some animations. Inside this, I load the animation and assign it to a game object. The next step was to modify each frame the position, rotation and scale of each bone based on the animation so that we can see it. One of the last steps was to duplicate the mesh to make it animable. For this I have to copy all the data and pass it to another new mesh. With this I regenerated all the buffers. And finally, we change the mesh we want to render from normal to animate.
Unfortunately there is a problem when it comes to regenerating the buffers that causes everything to break and you cannot see the mesh being animated correctly. Therefore the animations are not active. I know that by the time the problem with the buffers is solved, everything would work correctly. I am wholeheartedly sorry for not being able to finish the upgrade but I couldn't find a way to fix it.
